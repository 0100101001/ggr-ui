# Ggr UI

Ggr UI is a standalone daemon that automatically collects `/status` information from multiple [Selenoid](https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid) instances and returns it as a single `/status` API. When this daemon is running you can use [Selenoid UI](https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-ui) to see the state of the entire cluster.
